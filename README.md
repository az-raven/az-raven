I'm currently working towards an Associate's degree in Computer Programming, with a concentration
in VR development. My notable projects include Compensation Social, Relay, and the Subsurface Studios
utilities ([SharedUtils](https://github.com/SubsurfaceStudios/SharedUtils), [slightmapper](https://github.com/SubsurfaceStudios/slightmapper), etc).  

I have a website at [az-raven.com](https://az-raven.com). I occasionally make blog posts there when I feel like it.
