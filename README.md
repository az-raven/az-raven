# About
Hey there! I'm Rose, a game developer working for Subsurface Studios.  

I have completed an Associate's of Applied Science (Hons) in Computer Programming, with a concentration in Virtual Reality Development.

I have a website at [az-raven.com](https://az-raven.com). I occasionally make blog posts there when I feel like it.  
I have a fairly small set of public socials:
- Business Inquiries: [rose@subsurface.dev](mailto://rose@subsurface.dev)
- YouTube: [@raven_dev](https://youtube.com/@raven_dev) - see my random prototypes here!
